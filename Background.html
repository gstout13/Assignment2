            What Is A Fixed-Gear Bicycle?

            In its utmost, a bicycle serves as both a mode of transportation and a recreational output, intent on putting humanity to its test of endurance in the pursuit of speed. A fixed-gear bicycle, while  having both experienced, and passed, its cultural prime, is one of the most primitive and direct ways of accessing the primeval drive to transition through space. Much like the original, first generation bicycles, fixed-gears have, in fact, gears which are fixed directly to the wheel. This means that for every motion forward (or backwards), both gears (known as your ratio) must also spin, in turn harnessing this power of movement through the pedals of the bicycle. This allows for a relationship with the earth's surface that is often akin to driving a stick shift car, where an intuited level of connection is formed that requires the utmost intentionality.
